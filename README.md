Smart Home Mini Program Features Overview

Project Overview

This project is developed based on uni-app, designed for WeChat Mini Programs, and built using Vue3. This project does not rely on a backend, and all data is simulated to ensure a lightweight and efficient experience.

Features

1. Intelligent Control

Users can remotely control various smart devices in their homes through the mini program, such as lights, air conditioners, TVs, and curtains. In addition to basic on/off control, users can make finer adjustments, such as adjusting the brightness and color temperature of lights or setting the temperature and fan speed of air conditioners.

2. Scene Settings

Users can customize different scene modes according to their needs, such as "Movie Mode," "Sleep Mode," and "Party Mode." In each mode, the mini program will automatically adjust related home devices to create an atmosphere that matches the scene.

3. Environmental Awareness

The mini program can sense home environment parameters in real-time, such as temperature, humidity, and lighting. Based on these parameters, the mini program can automatically adjust home devices, such as regulating air conditioner temperature and humidity or automatically turning lights on and off.

4. Device Management

Users can discover new smart devices through the mini program and bind them. Additionally, users can delete devices they no longer use or modify basic device information, such as names and groupings, for better management of home devices.

5. Information Feedback

The mini program can provide real-time feedback on the operational status of smart home devices directly to the user's phone, allowing users to monitor their devices at any time. Additionally, if a device encounters an abnormal situation, the mini program will promptly send an alert notification to remind the user to take action.

Conclusion

This mini program enhances the smart home experience through intelligent control, scene settings, environmental awareness, device management, and information feedback, providing users with a more convenient, secure, and efficient smart home system.
